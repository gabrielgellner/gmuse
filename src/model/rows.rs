//! What a list needs to know about a row — issue #84.
//!
//! The seam's read contract, small enough to state in one trait.
//!
//! `ui/list.rs` takes a `&Store` for one reason: to ask, of an arbitrary slice
//! of ids, what each row groups under and what it should say. That is a
//! question about the *library*, not about a store, and naming it as a trait is
//! what lets the answer come from somewhere else later without the renderer
//! noticing.
//!
//! Deliberately not `Row` from `seam.rs`. That one is the whole projection —
//! ratings, plays, quality, availability — assembled per recording. This is
//! what a **list** needs to draw a divider, which is three strings and a
//! number, borrowed rather than built. A view that scrolls past a thousand
//! rows should not allocate a thousand `String`s to decide where the albums
//! change.
